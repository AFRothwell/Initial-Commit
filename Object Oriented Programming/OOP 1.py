Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Exercise: Classes and Objects Exercises
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source: https://pynative.com/python-object-oriented-programming-oop-exercise/

Python Object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on the concept of “objects,”
which can contain data and code:
    
    Data in the form of instance variables
    (often known as attributes or properties).
    
    Code in the form method: I.e., Using OOP, we encapsulate related
    properties and behaviors into individual objects.



This OOP exercise covers questions on the following topics:

- Class and Object creation
- Instance variables and Methods, and Class level attributes
- Model systems with class inheritance i.e., inherit From Other Classes
- Parent Classes and Child Classes
- Extend the functionality of Parent Classes using Child class
- Object checking

OOP Exercise 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    
    Create a class - "Vehicle"
        with 2 attributes - "max_speed" and "mileage".
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage):
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

modelX = Vehicle(240, 18)
print(modelX.max_speed, modelX.mileage)
